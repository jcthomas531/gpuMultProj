# Final project for bios7330

comparing various matrix multiplication algorithms on gpus

# Workflow

multKernels.py -> utilities.py -> multAnalysis.py -> multSummary.py

Everything else is periphary but I dont have a second right now to make a neat .gitignore
If you use this and you are not me you will need to update filepaths
You need to have an environment that works with a gpu for this to operate, ie a conda environment
